Description             : Base file for use in creating mods for Harmony
                          1.1 or later.
                          
                          When Harmony 1.0 was release I had trouble
                          running it on Linux.  My solution was to
                          translate the DeHackEd patches into modern lumps,
                          which allowed me to play the game.  I submitted
                          the lumps to t.v., but he didn't want them since
                          he hasn't learn to use the new formats yet.
                          
                          In any case I feel that the lump can still be
                          useful for anyone who may want to create a mod
                          for Harmony (particularly more elaborate ones). 
                          In addition I didn't my effort to go to waste.
                          
                          There is one difference in my patch that I recall
                          is that the hand grenades do not have autoaim,
                          but this can easily be reverted.

                          As of Harmony 1.1, this also fixes a bug where the
                         icons on the fullscreen hud are not properly scaled.
